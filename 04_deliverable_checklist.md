## Example checklist for your Reporting Format deliverables

We suggest creating a checklist like the one below (e.g., as a Google Doc) to see if you've met all of the deliverables outlined in you Statement of Work. While deliverables will vary with each Statement of Work and Reporting Format team, we provide some examples of common deliverables and how they can be met.

Click the links within the checklist to see a more complete description of the deliverable, with links to completed examples. As a reminder, *this is an example list of deliverables* and your list of deliverables may deviate from the list below.

- [ ] [Attending monthly calls](#attending-monthly-calls)  
- [ ] [Quarterly reports](#quarterly-reports)  
- [ ] [Documents that define reporting format](#documents-that-define-reporting-format)  
- [ ] [Methods narrative](#methods-narrative)   
- [ ] [Terminology crosswalk](#terminology-crosswalk)  
- [ ] [Open source software](#open-source-software)  

## Attending monthly calls  
One deliverable that is often provided in a Statement of Work is attending monthly community calls during the development phase of data reporting formats.  These virtual meetings provide a chance for teams developing reporting formats to present their work, get feedback from other teams, and share best practices.  

## Quarterly reports  
Quarterly reports provide the ESS-DIVE team with updates on data reporting format progress and identify areas where support may be needed.

## Documents that define reporting format  
This encompasses all of the documents and templates that are part of the data and/or metadata reporting formats.  This is typically the content that you developed and edited on google drive, but eventually upload to a GitHub repository and to the ESS-DIVE repository.

## Methods narrative  
Provide a short (2-3 paragraph) methods narrative detailing your process for developing and gathering feedback on your reporting format.  For an example checklist of what you might choose to include in a methods narrative see a separate document we created for the narrative [here](template_for_methods_narrative.md). **The methods narrative is uploaded as part of submitting your ESS-DIVE data package (under the 'methods & sampling' section)**. It does not need to be part of your GitHub repository. 

## Terminology crosswalk  
Compiling a reporting format crosswalk that demonstrates how the field names in your reporting format incorporate our build on other related reporting formats or data standards  

## Open source software
