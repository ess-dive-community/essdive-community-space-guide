## The purpose of the Community Space  
ESS-DIVE started our GitHub Community Space to provide a location where the ESS-DIVE user community can upload documents, code, and tools related to the [ESS-DIVE data repository](http://ess-dive.lbl.gov/).  

We designed this meta-repository so that contributors to the Community Space can familiarize themselves with the process of contributing to an existing GitHub repository or starting their own.  The chapters in this repository provide visitors with information on starting up a GitHub account or repository (Chapters 1 & 2) as well as developing and publishing data reporting formats with ESS-DIVE (Chapters 3 & 4).
